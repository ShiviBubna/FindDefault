This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. Using a dataset of transactions, we will analyze patterns and characteristics that distinguish legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for ease of visualization and interaction.

Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-project.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd fraud-detection-project

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook

4. Open the fraud_detection.ipynb notebook.
